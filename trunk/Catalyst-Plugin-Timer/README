NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Timer - Timer for profiling catalyst applications.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/-Debug Timer/;

        ... in an action somewhere ...

        $c->start_timer("foo");

        ...

        $c->stop_timer("foo");

        $c->timer("bar");

        ...

        $c->timer("bar");

DESCRIPTION
    Simple timer for simple profiling of catalyst applications.

    Bracket parts of your code that you suspect may be slow with start_timer
    and stop_timer calls and you will see additional lines in your debug
    output showing you how much time that chunk of code took.

    If the same name is reused -- either because you used it twice, or
    because it lies within a loop, or a subroutine which is called more than
    once -- then just a single total accumulated time is displayed.

METHODS
    start_timer
    stop_timer
    timer
        Starts and stops the timer. timer is an alias for lazy people who
        don't like to type five more characters. It automatically calls
        start or stop as appropriate.
