NAME
    Catalyst::Engine::Apache - Catalyst Apache Engines

SYNOPSIS
    For example Apache configurations, see the documentation for the engine
    that corresponds to your Apache version.

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache::MP13" - mod_perl 1.3x

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP19" - mod_perl 1.99x

    "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP20" - mod_perl 2.x

DESCRIPTION
    These classes provide mod_perl support for Catalyst.

METHODS
  $c->engine->apache
    Returns an "Apache", "Apache::RequestRec" or "Apache2::RequestRec"
    object, depending on your mod_perl version. This method is also
    available as $c->apache.

  $c->engine->return
    If you need to return something other than OK from the mod_perl handler,
    you may set any other Apache constant in this method. You should only
    use this method if you know what you are doing or bad things may happen!
    For example, to return DECLINED in mod_perl 2:

        use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(DECLINED);
        $c->engine->return( Apache2::Const::DECLINED );

OVERLOADED METHODS
    This class overloads some methods from "Catalyst::Engine".

    $c->engine->prepare_request($r)
    $c->engine->prepare_connection
    $c->engine->prepare_query_parameters
    $c->engine->prepare_headers
    $c->engine->prepare_path
    $c->engine->read_chunk
