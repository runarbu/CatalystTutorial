=head1 Catalyst Advent - Day 21 - A Catalyst Blog

Today you get some special candy.

This calendar will end in a few days but don't be sad, there is
a Catalyst blog at L<http://catalystframework.org/random> now,
which will continue to deliver the latest recipes and much more!

The blog software we are using is a Catalyst application called Agave
and the source code is available at
L<http://svn.rawmode.org/repos/Agave/trunk>.

Have fun!

-- Sebastian
