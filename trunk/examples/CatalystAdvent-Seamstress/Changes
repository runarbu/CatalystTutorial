	*  line 26 of year.tt does not make much sense:
	http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/browser/trunk/examples/CatalystAdvent/root/year.tt  ... it sets the class of the td to "link $something" but there is no corresponding class in screen.css (http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/browser/trunk/examples/CatalystAdvent/root/static/css/screen.css) so in the Seamstress rework I am making that class attribute sensible and adding some css to make it visually distinct.

	* removed DefaultEnd and added an end block which will forward to
	Seamstress when possible and tt otherwise. Thus starteth the
	incremental conversion of CatalystAdvent
