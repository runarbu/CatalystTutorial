ServerDB TODO
=============

* There is some kind of tied hash bug with TT and/or Perl 5.8.4 causing the "keys" vmethod to not work on tied hashes.  I had to add some dirty hacks to work around this.

* There is currently no way to add/remove servers via the web.  This wasn't a requirement for the original application so I never wrote it.

chansen's ideas:
* Use PROCESS instead of INCLUDE
* Look into using WRAPPER
