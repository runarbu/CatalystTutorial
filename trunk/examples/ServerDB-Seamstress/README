ServerDB

Quick Start
===========
1. Check your prerequisites by running perl Build.PL
2. script/serverdb_server.pl
3. http://yourserver:3000
4. Login as admin/12345 or user/12345.

About
=====
This Catalyst application displays a list of servers and allows you to manage the list of 
applications installed on each server.

This is based off a real application prototype I've built which uses many different database fields.  That's why there is some apparently unused stuff in here like "support history".

I've populated this sample with data from the list of public NTP time servers.

Features:
User authentication and roles
Pagination
Sorting
Searching (with Plucene)

Dependencies
============
Catalyst >= 5.23

The database & index
====================
You can use the pre-existing SQLite database and Plucene index.  However, you may want to regenerate these or add additional servers to the database.  To do this, run the following commands:
$ rm -f ServerDB.db
$ sqlite ServerDB.db < ServerDB.sql
$ sqlite ServerDB.db < ServerDB-data.sql

To run the create scripts, you will need to edit the file lib/ServerDB/Script/CDBI.pm and change the $dsn variable to the path to your own database.

Add a bunch of NTP server data by running:
$ script/createServers.pl

You should then rebuild the Plucene search index by running:
$ script/createIndex.pl plucene

Of course, replace the paths in those commands with your own.

Known Issues
============
None at the moment.
