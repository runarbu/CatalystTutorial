=head1 NAME

Catalyst::View::TT::FunctionGenerator - Generate functions from ... to be used from a TT view

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # running this:

    prompty_wompty> scripts/myapp_create.pl create view ViewName TT

    # generates a Template Toolkit view component.
    # change the base class like this:

    use base 'Catalyst::View::TT::FunctionGenerator';

    # In a nearby action method (in Controller code)
    sub action : Local {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

        $c->view("ViewName")->generate_functions('prototype');
        # OR
        $c->view("ViewName")->generate_functions($c->prototype);
        # OR
        $c->view("ViewName")->generate_functions([$c, 'uri_for']);

    }

    # In your template, we can now have:
    [% link_to_remote("foo", { url => uri_for("blah")  } ) %]

    # instead of saying this:
    [% c.prototype.link_to_remote("foo", { url => c.uri_for("blah")  } ) %]

Note that the most appropriate place to put this code is probably in an C<end>
action at the top level of your application so that access to these functions
in uniform accross your templates.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module stuffs given methods as coderefs into your TT variables, enabling the
use of shorter names in your templates. To use this plugin, you will need to
be using the Singleton plugin as well (so that we only populate one correct
copy of the context object).

To use, first create a L<Catalyst::View::TT> module in the usual way (see
synopsis), then change its base class to this module. To add the method
shortcuts, call the generate_functions method in your controller code, in an
action, before forwarding to your template. 

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item generate_functions

This is the only available method. It's parameters are a list of one or more
of the following:

=over 4

=item [ $object or method name, (list of method names)]

An arrayref, where the first item in the array is either an object (e.g. what
C<< $c->prototype >> returns), or a method name that will return an object,
when called upon C<$c>, e.g. "prototype". The other array items are the method
names of the given object that will be created as template vars.

=item $object

An object (blessed reference). All methods found for the object will be
created as template vars.

=item A method name

The method name will be called upon <$c>, and all methods for the resulting
object will be added as template vars.
