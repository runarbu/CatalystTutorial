        - Fixed race condition in HTTP header test.

        - Send cache headers on all requests (was not sending on first request) (moseley)
        - Added ability to pass in a DateTime object to expire at a specific
          time (moseley)
        - Added ability to pass in an options list to set the cache expires
          time separately from the expires time sent to client. (moseley)
        - Test If-Modified-Since headers on request that loads the page cache.
          Was only testing when returning a page already in the page cache. (moseley)

        - Fixed bug in cache key generation that ignored duplicate key names.
        - Fixed bug where clear_cached_page called with a regex did not
          properly remove the page from cache.
        - Fixed bug where cache metadata was not set properly if
          content-type or content-encoding was missing.
        - Added test suite.
        - Code cleanup per Best Practices.

        - Removed dependence on HTTP::Date.
        - Make sure the same cache key checked during the dispatch phase
          is used during the finalize phase.  This avoids problems if the
          user adds or deletes request parameters.

0.08    2005-06-16 00:20:00
        - Debug is now enabled by default if in Catalyst -Debug mode.

        - Fixed bug in clear_cached_page when cache index is not
          available.
