Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Session

0.13
        - add `clear_flash`
        - improve debug logging

0.12
        - refactor out a hookable finalize_session method, for plugins
        - make _clear_session_instance_data call NEXT::, so that plugins can
          hook on to that too

0.11
        - Lazify expiry calculation and store it in a different instance data
          slot. This provides greater flexibility for implementing hooks like
          DynamicExpiry the "right" way.

0.10
        - Implement a more well defined finalization order for Session stuff.
          This solves a problem that was introduced by some value cleanups in
          the 0.06 release.

0.09
        - Fix Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Test::Store

0.08
        - rerelease because Module::Bane broke the META.yml. HURAAH

0.07
        - Make build tool complain loudly on incompatible versions of state
          plugins.

0.06
        - Change State plugin API to be pull oriented
        - Lazify more correctly (mostly performance improvements)
        - Don't try to compute digest of hash when there is no hash

0.05     
        - Un-workaround the Cache::FastMmap (actually Storable) limitation -
          it's not C::P::Session's business.
        - add $c->session_expires
        - refactor guts
        - improve semantics of session deletion (now deletes flash data too)
        - improve lazy-load-ness of session data in the light of expiration

0.04    2005-12-28 09:42:00
        - Work around a limitation in Cache::FastMmap - must store only
          references, while expiration was an NV.

0.03    2005-12-26 10:22:00
        - Lazify loading of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions
        - support for $c->flash a la Ruby on Rails
        - Fixed bug in sessionid algorithm detection.
        - Separate __expires from the session data - we write it every time
        - Lazify saving of session data for better performance and less chance
          of race conditions

0.02    2005-11-23 09:40:00
