DESCRIPTION
    This is the "HTML::Template" view class. Your subclass should inherit
    from this class.

  METHODS
    process
        Renders the template specified in "$c->stash->{template}" or
        "$c->request->match". Template params are set up from the contents
        of "$c->stash", augmented with "base" set to "$c->req->base" and
        "name" to "$c->config->{name}". Output is stored in
        "$c->response->body".

    config
        This allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to the
        HTML::Template config hash.

SEE ALSO
    HTML::Template, Catalyst, Catalyst::Base.
