NAME
    Catalyst::Engine::Zeus - Catalyst Zeus Engine

SYNOPSIS
    See Catalyst.

DESCRIPTION
    This is the Catalyst engine specialized for Zeus Web Server V4.

OVERLOADED METHODS
    This class overloads some methods from "Catalyst::Engine::Zeus::Base"
    and "Catalyst::Engine::CGI".

    $c->prepare_body
    $c->prepare_parameters
    $c->prepare_request($r)
    $c->prepare_uploads

BUGS
    There is a bug in "Zeus::ModPerl::Request" that keeps us from using it
    so we are currently reverting back to "CGI" for params and uploads.
