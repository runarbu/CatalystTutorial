=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Model::XML::Feed - Use RSS/Atom feeds as a Catalyst Model

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your own model:

     package MyApp::Model::Feeds;
     use base qw(Catalyst::Model::XML::Feed);
     
Then from elsewhere in your application:
 
     $c->model('Feeds')->register('delicious', 'http://del.icio.us/rss');
     $c->model('Feeds')->register('http://blog.jrock.us/');
  
     my @feeds     = $c->model('Feeds')->get_all_feeds;
     my $delicious = $c->model('Feeds')->get('delicious');

You can also pre-register feeds from your config file:

     ---
     Model::Feeds:
       feeds:
         - uri: http://blog.jrock.us/
         - uri: http://search.cpan.org/
         - title: delicious
           uri: http://del.icio.us/rss/

See CONFIGURATION below for details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Catalyst::Model::XML::Feed allows you to use XML feeds in your
Catalyst application.  To use a feed, you need to register it with
the C<register> method.

Once a feed is registered, it's automatically cached for you.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is accepted via the standard Catalyst method:

    $c->config->{Model::Feeds}->{key} = $value;

Valid keys include:

=over 4

=item ttl 

Time To Live, in seconds, for each feed.  If a feed is older than this
value, it is refreshed from its source.  Defaults to 3600 seconds, 1 hour.

=item feeds

An arrayref of hashes containing feeds to preload.  The hash is
required to contain a key called "uri" or "location", specifing the
URL of the feed to load.  It may optinally contain "name" or "title",
if you wish to override the feed's own title.

=back

Example config in MyApp.yml (assuming you call your feed model
C<Feeds>):

     Model::Feeds:
       feeds:
         - uri: http://blog.jrock.us/
         - title: delicious
           location: http://del.icio.us/rss/
       ttl: 1337

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new instance.  Called for you by Catalyst.  If your config
file contains invalid feeds, this will die and kill your entire app,
so be careful.

sub new {
    my $self = shift;
    $self = $self->NEXT::new(@_);
    my @in_feeds = eval { @{$self->feeds} };
    $self->feeds({});
    
    $self->ttl($self->ttl || 3600);
    foreach my $feed (@in_feeds) {
	my $name = $feed->{name} || $feed->{title};
	my $uri  = $feed->{uri}  || $feed->{location};
	#my $c = $_[0];
	if($name){
	    #$c->log->debug("registering XML feed $uri as $name") if $c;
	    $self->register($name, $uri);
	}
	else {
	    #$c->log->debug("registering XML feed $uri") if $c;
	    my @names = $self->register($uri);
	    my $name = join q{,},@names;
	    #$c->log->debug("feed(s) at $uri created as $name") if $c;
	}
    }
    
    return $self;
}

=head2 register($uri_of_feed)

Registers a feed with the Model.  If C<$uri_of_feed> points to a feed,
the feed is added under its own name.  If $C<$uri_of_feed> points to
an HTML or XHTML document containing C<< <link> >> tags pointing to
feeds, all feeds are added by using their URIs as their names.

Returns a list of the names of the feeds that were added.

Throws an exception if the C<$uri_of_feeds> doesn't contain a feed
or links to feeds, or it cannot be fetched.

=head2 register($name, $uri_of_feed)

Registers a feed with the Model.  If C<$name> is already registered,
the old feed at C<$name> is forgotten and replaced with the new feed
at C<$uri_of_feed>.  The C<title> of the feed is replaced with
C<$name>.

Throws an exception if C<$uri_of_feed> isn't an XML feed (or doesn't
contain a C<link> to one).  

Throws an exception if the C<$uri_of_feed> links to multiple feeds.

=head2 names

Returns the names of all registered feeds.

=head2 get_all_feeds

Returns a list of all registered feeds.  The elements are
C<XML::Feed> objects.

}

=head2 get($name)

Returns the C<XML::Feed> object that corresponds to C<$name>.  Throws
an exception if there is no feed that's named C<$name>.

=cut

sub get {
    my $self = shift;
    my $name = shift;

    if(time - $feed->updated > $self->ttl){

    }

}

=head2 refresh([$name])

Forces the feed C<$name> to be refreshed from the source. If C<$name>
is omitted, refreshes all registered feeds.

=cut

sub refresh {
    my $self = shift;
    my $name = shift;

}

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 %s does not reference any feeds

The URI you passed to C<register> was not a feed, or did not
C<link> to any feeds.

=head2 %s points to too many feeds

The URI you passed to C<register> referenced more than one feed.  If
you want to register all the feeds, use the one argument form of
C<register> instead of the two argument form.

=head2 No feed named %s

The feed that you requested does not exist.  Try registering it first.
