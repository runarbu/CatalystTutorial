=head1 THANKS

This tutorial would not have been possible without the input of many 
different people in the Catalyst community.  In particular, the 
primary author would like to thank:

=over 4

=item *

Sebastian Riedel for founding the Catalyst project.

=item *

The members of the Catalyst Core Team for their tireless efforts to
advance the Catalyst project.  Although all of the Core Team members
have played a key role in this tutorial, it would have never been
possible without the critical contributions of: Matt Trout, for his
unfathomable knowledge of all things Perl and Catalyst (and his
willingness to answer lots of my questions); Jesse Sheidlower, for his
incredible skill with the written word and dedication to improving the
Catalyst documentation; and Yuval Kogman, for his work on the Catalyst
"Auth & Authz" plugins (the original focus of the tutorial) and other
key Catalyst modules.

=item *

Other Catalyst documentation folks like Kieren Diment, Gavin Henry,
and Jess Robinson (including their work on the original Catalyst
tutorial).

=item *

Everyone on #catalyst and #catalyst-dev.

=item *

People who have emailed me with corrections and suggestions on the 
tutorial.  As of the most recent release, this include: Florian Ragwitz, 
Mauro Andreolini, Jim Howard, Giovanni Gigante, William Moreno,  
Bryan Roach, Ashley Berlin, David Kamholz, and Kevin Old.
