NAME
    HTML::Prototype::Useful - Some useful additions for the Prototype
    library.

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::Prototype::Useful;
      $protype=HTML::Prototype::Useful->new();
      print $prototype->call_remote( ... )
      print $prototype->lazy_observe_field( .. )

DESCRIPTION
     this adds some more useful features for AJAX development based on the 
     Prototype library, as L<HTML::Prototype> is a straight port of the ruby
     implementation.

  METHODS
    define_javascript_functions
        Returns the javascript required for HTML::Prototype as well as this
        module.

    remote_function
        Generate a remote function that you can stuff into your js
        somewhere.

    lazy_observe_field
        like HTML::Prototype's observe_field method, but only detect changes
        after a user has stopped typing for "frequency".

    $p->observe_hover( $id \%options );
        Observes the element with the DOM ID specified by $id and makes an
        Ajax when you hover the mouse over it for at least <frequency>
        seconds.

        Takes the same arguments as observe_field.
