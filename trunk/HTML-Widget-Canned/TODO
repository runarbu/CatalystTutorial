Widget Gallery

These are sub-widgets that have their own default validation and inputs.

They need to support composing N instances per super-widget (like
shipping + billing address, in the same form), perhaps by input name
prefixes, (or Catalyst::Plugin::Params::Nested).

The widgets may have optional javascript enhancement, like the date fields
becoming more interactive (like with a little calendar popup on the side) that
can enhance the user experience if javascript is turned on, but with no
limitations whatsoever (verification is still serverside, etc).

Note that this javascript is in addition to optional javascript validation.

            * country for intl code
            * regional phones can have prefixes (israel has different "area
