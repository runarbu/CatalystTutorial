NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Pluggable - Plugin for Pluggable Catalyst applications

SYNOPSIS
        # use it
        use Catalyst qw/Pluggable/;

        $c->forward_all('do_stuff');

DESCRIPTION
    Pluggable Catalyst applications.

  METHODS
   $c->forward_all($action,[$argsref $sortref])
        Like C<forward>, but forwards to all actions with the same name in the
        whole application, ordered by class name by default.
        The optional $sortref parameter allows you to pass a code reference
        to a function that will be used in the sort function. The default
        here is { $a->{class} cmp $b->{class} }
