This is the official ROADMAP for the Catalyst project, all points on this list are priority goals and should be addressed as soon as possible.
If you wonder who's allowed to make changes to it you are not one of them. :)

0. There are no *big* changes planned in the near future, we will just add new features when a need arises.

1. Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema needs documentation equal in quality to Catalyst::View::TT

2. Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema needs clean helper templates, the current ones are useless. I suggest to generate a schema class to maintain connection data and other meta stuff and a generic example table class, which can then be copied for the real tables.

3. The Catalyst Advent Calendar should be reformatted to a new Catalyst::Manual::Cookbook.

4. All core developers should have a blog somewhere (even mst :), random thoughts will be replaced with a feed aggregator.

5. Destroy the sun!

There is no cabal.
