NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::DynamicExpiry - set expiry of cookies per
    session

SYNOPSIS
        # put Session::DynamicExpiry in your use Catalyst line
    
        if ($c->req->param('remember') { 
          $c->session->{__time_to_live}=604800 # expire in one week.
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to expire session cookies indvidually per
    session. If loaded, it looks for a "__cookie_time_to_live" key in the
    session hash, and sets expiry to that many seconds into the future. Note
    that the session cookie is set on every request, so a expiry of one week
    will stay as long as the user visits the site at least once a week.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
  calc_cookie_expiry
    Overridden to implement dynamic expiry functionality.
