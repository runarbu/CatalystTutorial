       This is the "Data::Serializer" view class.  It can be used to use any
       number of Serialization methods (YAML, Storable, Data::Dumper) to
       implement a REST view.  It also supports optional compression, encryp-
       tion, and a host of other useful goodies.

       Any of the options you can pass to Data::Serializer you can put into
       $c->config->{'serializer'}, and have them passed on to it.  If you
       don't pass any options, the following are used:

                   serializer       => 'Data::Dumper',
                   digester         => 'SHA1',
                   cipher           => 'Blowfish',
                   secret           => undef,
                   portable         => '1',
                   compress         => '0',
                   serializer_token => '1',
                   options          => {},

       They are the same as the Data::Serializer defaults.  The only addi-
       tional option is:

       _a_s_t_e_x_t

       Setting this to a true value will allow you to pass the "astext=1"
       param to any request processed by this View.  The results will be the
       contents of $c->stash passed through Data::Dumper, as opposed to your
       Serialized object.

       This should be turned off in production environments concerned about
       security.  It's great for debugging, though!

       _p_r_o_c_e_s_s

       Serializes $c->stash to $c->response->output.  If you pass "astext=1"
       as a param, and the $c->config->{'serializer'}->{'astext'} option is
       true, then it will return the output of the stash via Data::Dumper.
