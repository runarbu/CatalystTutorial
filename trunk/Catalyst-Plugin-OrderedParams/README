NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::OrderedParams - Maintain order of submitted form
    parameters

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst;
        MyApp->setup( qw/OrderedParams/ );

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin enables handling of GET and POST parameters in an ordered
    fashion. By default in Catalyst, form parameters are stored in a simple
    hash, which loses the original order in which the parameters were
    submitted. This plugin stores parameters in a Tie::IxHash which will
    retain the original submitted order.

    One particular application for this plugin is email handlers, where you
    want the output of your email to reflect the order of form elements in
    the form.

    Simply add this plugin to your application and the following code will
    be in the proper order.

        for my $param ( $c->req->param ) {
            $email .= $param . ": " . $c->req->param( $param );
        }

CAVEATS
    Note that technically according to RFC2388, the ordering of fields
    submitted by a form does not have to follow the order of the form
    elements displayed on the page. However, I believe most, if not all,
    common browsers do follow this convention. This plugin has been tested
    with both IE6 and Firefox 1.0.6.
