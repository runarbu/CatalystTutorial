SYNOPSIS

        use Module::Pluggable::Fast
          name   => 'components',
          search => [ qw/MyClass::Model MyClass::View MyClass::Controller/ ];

        package MyOtherClass;
        use MyClass;
        my @components = MyClass->components;

   search
    Arrayref containing a list of namespaces to search for plugins. Defaults
    to the ::Plugin:: namespace of the calling class.
